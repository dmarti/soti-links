In this light, our solution is to devise a methodology and program to assist a journalist to identify if an image and associated title are trustworthy. The fundamentals of our approach are based on corroboration of news, i.e, the image must be used in credible news websites with text similar to that of the associated title for the image and text to be reliable. If not, we recommend that the journalist (or user) perform a human verification procedure.","1.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1.0","","","",""
